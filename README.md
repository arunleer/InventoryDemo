# Inventory Demo

My first foray into C++, designing the inventory system for a single-player RPG game currently in part-time development.

To run, make sure you've installed SQLite. Compile the cpp files together and link with SQLite's library. 

g++ main.cpp Inventory.cpp Item.cpp DatabaseManager.cpp -lsqlite3 -o inventoryApp

Run the generated binary "inventoryApp".
