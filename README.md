# Inventory System for RPG Game

My first foray into C++, designing the inventory system for a single-player RPG game currently in part-time development.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you've installed [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/download.html).

## Compilation and Running

1. Compile the cpp files together and link with SQLite's library:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp Inventory.cpp Item.cpp DatabaseManager.cpp -lsqlite3 -o inventoryApp
    ```

2. Run the generated binary:
    ```bash
    ./inventoryApp
    ```
